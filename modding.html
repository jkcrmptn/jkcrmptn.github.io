  <h3>Killing Floor 1</h3>
  <p><b>KF-WestLondon-ST - Type: Map Edit</b></p>
  <p>You all know it, you all probably love it. West London, the favorite map from Killing Floor's vanilla lineup. This is an edit by me to add some new life to the map and better connect it to the rest of Killing Floor 1's maps.</p>
  <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3653307510">Steam Workshop</a><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ACWTF1nRGzqxjFlEjX46NLE_SFNLMMBb/view">Google Drive</a>
  <p><b>KF-MC-Pharus-ST - Type: Map Edit</b></p>
  <p>The Minecraft map by SIMOX, updated with enhancements to the gameplay and visuals for the Siren Torturers server. All credit for the base map goes to SIMOX, some meshes were created by Krull0r and borrowed from KF-ZedCraft. The map edit was put together by me.</p>
  <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3637082864">Steam Workshop</a><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x4vg3Pqv8vr_56bGnvK8bQZn9taUZCkE/view">Google Drive</a>
  <p><b>KF-AbusementPark2011 - Type: Map Archive</b></p>
  <p>This is the actual original 2011 Abusement Park map file. With original signage, lack of Hellride stuff and no dancing robot. This will also have all original glitches. The other 2011 Abusement Park is a remake which couldn't do the original signage since it was replaced in the files, but this has the old textures embedded into the map file, only other change to the map file was setting up the music trigger to be correct.</p>

  <p><b>KF-Aperture2011-NoMiddle - Type: Map Archive</b></p>
  <p>This is the ORIGINAL ORIGINAL map file for Aperture, from phase 3 of the ARG. It had the teleports to the computer rooms, but the middle area was inaccessible, with GlaDOS not being in there either. Which also meant no Golden Potato secret.</p>

  <p><b>KF-FestiveOffices - Type: Map Edit</b></p>
  <p>The real Robo-Santa has escaped you once again! From a portal inside the Thrills Chills amusement park, you were able to follow him to this office building, seemingly another one of Santa's facilities for spreading cheer that he is going to use to spread death. Now is your chance to finally take out Robot Santa. After it's done you can keep the change, you filthy animal!</p>

  <p><b>KF-MoonBase2012 - Type: Map Archive</b></p>
  <p>This is nearly identical to the current one this one just has slight Christmas decoration that was removed after the event, slightly higher quality lighting with less artifacting and ~ in the map description for some reason. This might have some bugs that got patched out but I'm not sure.</p>

  <p><b>KF-SpookyManor - Type: Map Edit</b></p>
  <p>The Halloween season is upon you, this manor which was once decaying and dark, is now decaying and lit up! Lights cover the outside of the house, but a strange stench of death is around the whole area, and was that water always red? Anyways, you are your team better think of where you are going to hold out, and fast.</p>

  <p><b>KF-Oakview - Type: Map</b></p>
  <p>Welcome to Oakview Mall, a once lively and vibrant shopping center now taken over by abandonment and decay. When the first sightings and murders happened in the US, this entire state was evacuated after the monsters swept the country like the plague. Now this place, relatively untouched by the creatures from London, proves to be a possible holdout spot for survivors. We tasked you and your squad with taking out the existing enemy presence in this old mall. Your success in this mission will give us a big advantage against these creatures with a defendable area to house civilians and soldiers. Exterminate and Exfil.</p>

<h3>Viscera Cleanup Detail</h3>
  <p><b>Freak Circus - Type: Map</b></p>
  <p>A dirty circus, filled with freaks. Brought up this October a bunch of carnies with their twisted ringleader. It was business as usual until some of the subjects started lashing out. In what seems to be a case of the "freaks" being mistreated, it seems to have ended in tragedy as they broke out, killing many people, including staff and the ringleader himself. After a cleanup team was sent in, it is your job to clean up this mess. Don't spend too much time playing games.</p>

  <p><b>JK's Hatless Ralsei Battle Icons - Type: Sprite Replacement</b></p>
  <p>It annoys me that Ralsei still has a hat in the battle icons of chapters 2, 3 and 4. Why? I'm petty idk.

I included xdelta patches and the raw sprites if you want to use this in anything else. You can use it just please credit me.</p>
