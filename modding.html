We tasked you and your squad with taking out the existing enemy presence in this old mall. Your success in this mission will give us a big advantage against these creatures with a defendable area to house civilians and soldiers. Exterminate and Exfil.</p>

<h3>Viscera Cleanup Detail</h3>
  <p><b>Freak Circus - Type: Map</b></p>
  <p>A dirty circus, filled with freaks. Brought up this October a bunch of carnies with their twisted ringleader. It was business as usual until some of the subjects started lashing out. In what seems to be a case of the "freaks" being mistreated, it seems to have ended in tragedy as they broke out, killing many people, including staff and the ringleader himself. After a cleanup team was sent in, it is your job to clean up this mess. Don't spend too much time playing games.</p>
